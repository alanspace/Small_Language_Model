Across the vast expanse of space
The stars shine bright and clear
A lonely vessel drifts in place
While Earth hangs, crystal sphere

Through darkened void and cosmic night
Our ship sails ever on
Past nebulae of purple light
Where ancient stars were born

Mission Control to Spacecraft One
Systems check complete
The journey has at last begun
Our destiny to meet

Among the stars we float with grace
In zero gravity
Exploring every distant place
That human eyes can see

Below, the Earth in azure hue
Rotates in silent dance
While astronauts, both brave and true
Take one more daring chance

The cosmos beckons, vast and wide
With mysteries untold
Through space and time we boldly glide
On adventures yet to fold
